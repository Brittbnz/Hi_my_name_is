<h1>Brittany Zendejas</h1>

<p>I am from La Habra which is in Southern California. I came to the J-school because I felt that I needed more expertise in the journalism field.</p>
  
<p>I have written about housing, incarceration, and poverty. I am very passionate about my community and telling stories in any medium.</p>
    
<p> Since being at the J-school I have found a new love for audio. I am excited at the possibilites of telling stories through audio and crafting a story. </p>
    
<p> I think what I find most challenging about the J-school is the pressure that is placed upon us to perform. I am hoping that I'll be able to create meaningful stories without succumbing to that pressure.</p>
    
<p> I am happy that I have met people through this experience and I hope to keep createing those connections. I believe that those connections can help build a strong journalism community that I aspire to be a part of! </p>
